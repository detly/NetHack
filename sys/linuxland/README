# Linux Userland Nethack

This port is designed so:
  - A user can build, install and run it without system-wide access
  - A user can run it with the read-only data in one location and the variable
    parts in another
  - Multiple instances can be run simultaneously, with the same read-only
    location and different variable data locations
  - Email and shell access are denied
